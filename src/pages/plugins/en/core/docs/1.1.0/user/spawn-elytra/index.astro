    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
      The <strong>Spawn Elytra System</strong> gives players temporary elytra flight inside a defined <strong>elytra zone</strong>. An area set up by server administrators, usually around spawn or the starting island. 
      The feature helps players <strong>comfortably spread out across a larger area</strong> at the beginning of a season or event, without needing to equip their own elytra.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
      This system was inspired by the <strong>Craft Attack</strong> series and is designed to make the early-game experience smoother and more dynamic. 
      It allows everyone to take off and glide quickly from the starting area without granting long-term flight advantages.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">How It Works</h2>

    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
      Inside the elytra zone, you can <strong>activate flight by double jumping</strong>, just like with a regular elytra. 
      Once in the air, the spawn elytra behaves almost exactly like a normal one.
    </p>

    <div class="mb-8">
      <img src={boost_key} alt="Elytra Boost Key (F)" class="rounded-xl shadow-md max-w-full mx-auto" />
    </div>

    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
      While gliding, you can press the <strong>Swap Item With Off Hand</strong> key (<kbd>F</kbd> by default) to receive a one-time <strong>boost</strong>. 
      This helps you gain a bit of altitude or reach distant areas more easily.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
      The spawn elytra can only be <strong>activated inside the elytra zone</strong>. Once you’ve taken off, you can glide beyond the zone’s boundaries until you land. 
      However, you cannot start flying again unless you re-enter the defined zone.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Landing Rules & Improvements</h2>

    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
      In older versions of this system (from third-party plugins), players occasionally got stuck in the flying state after landing. 
      Our implementation improves <strong>landing detection</strong> and <strong>state management</strong>, making it very unlikely to remain stuck in flight.
    </p>

    <div class="mb-6">
      <img src={stuck_example} alt="Flying State Example" class="rounded-xl shadow-md max-w-full mx-auto" />
    </div>

    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
      In the rare event that it does happen, simply <strong>logging out and back in</strong> will always fix it. 
      However, it’s <strong>not recommended to log out mid-flight</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Restrictions</h2>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
      <li>The spawn elytra is only available in <strong>Survival</strong> and <strong>Adventure</strong> modes.</li>
      <li><strong>Firework rockets</strong> cannot be used with the spawn elytra (this can be changed in the config).</li>
      <li>If you have an actual elytra equipped, using the spawn elytra will <strong>drain durability</strong> from it.</li>
    </ul>
