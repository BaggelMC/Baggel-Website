      When a player is killed by another player, the victim will drop their <strong>Player Head</strong>. 
      The head uses the player’s skin at the time of their death, displays their username as the item name, 
      and includes the death message as the <em>lore</em>.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
      Note that the lore is lost when the head is placed and then broken again as a block. 
      This feature will not work if <code class="bg-background-10">keepInventory</code> is enabled.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
      You can disable this feature in the config file:
    </p>

    <pre class="mb-12 p-4 bg-background-10 rounded-xl overflow-x-auto text-sm mx-auto">
player-head:
  # When true, players will drop their head on death.
  on-death: true # Default: true</pre>

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
      That’s all there is to it. A simple but fun feature that rewards PvP encounters with a collectible memento.
